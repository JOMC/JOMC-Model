    Object management and configuration modlet classes.
    <p>
      The object management and configuration model is identified by the {@code http://jomc.org/model} public id in
      a {@code ModelContext}. The {@code any} property of a {@code Model} instance searched using that public id will
      hold a {@code JAXBElement<Modules>} instance to access using the {@code getAnyElement} method of class
      {@code Model}.<blockquote><pre>
final ModelContext modelContext = ModelContext.createModelContext( a class loader );
final Model model = modelContext.findModel( ModelObject.MODEL_PUBLIC_ID );
final Model processed = modelContext.processModel( model );
final ModelValidationReport validationReport = modelContext.validateModel( processed );
final Modules modules = ModelHelper.getModules( model );

final Model model = new Model();
model.setIdentifier( ModelObject.MODEL_PUBLIC_ID );
ModelHelper.setModules( model, new Modules() );
      </pre></blockquote>
